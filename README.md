Our VR group project collaboratives a remote-controlled helicopter game based on Ubiq[1], which aim to take a training activity for teaching people how to drive a helicopter by using Ubiq's built-in social virtual reality environment and interaction. We adopted Base Helicopter Controller assets by SunCube[2], which provide a realistic helicopter model and a keyboard-press based controller system. In this project, we establish the real-time synchronisation of the helicopter between multi-players. The position and rotation status will be shared by the messages.
